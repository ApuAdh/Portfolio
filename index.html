    <h2><a href="https://apuadh.github.io/Data-Science-One-Final-Project" target="_blank">Strongest Pokemon:</a> is the final project for my DataScienceOne Class. As of making this it is still incomplete. The project was to come up with a question you can answer with what you learned in that class. My questionw was which is the strongest pokemon for every type. I also decided to answer a few extra questions related to pokemon in that project as I thought my original question wasn't enough</h2>
